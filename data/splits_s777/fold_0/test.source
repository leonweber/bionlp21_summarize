Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?

ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint.  I have had undisguised ADHD since I was 8 years old. I sold illicit drugs from 1979-1989 in large quantity's & self medicated with amphetamines as an adolescent which damaged my Brian & worsened my symptoms. Because I have had several drug induced psychotic episodes since I was busted for trafficking in 1989 & was unable to self medicate on a daily basis. I was wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia 9years ago. The community psychiatrist's have treated me with all the wrong medication's that have made my ADHD symptoms worse & forced me to self medicate until now. I have no assets or money & I don't think it is worth while going on with out being put on the right medication Ritalin. When I take Meth amphetamines my symptoms improve & I haven't had any anti psychotic medication for 13 month's & have not gone psychotic or had any negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

SUBJECT: Levalbuterol and Budesonide Inhalation Products MESSAGE: After calling TEVA Pharmaceuticals, they relayed that the stability and storage information printed on their Levalbuterol 1.25 mg/3 mL and 0.63 mg/3 mL Inhalation Solution, as well as their Budesonide 0.5 mg/2 mL and 0.25 mg/2 mL Inhalation Suspension packages is information directly pulled from DailyMed, hence NIH. I am trying to determine if there is any extended stability information for either product, as the nebs are not singly packaged, and therefore a significant amount of product is being wasted in our facility due to the information provided. When name brand Xopenex was still available, Sepracor was able to provide our facility with more stablity information that enabled us to refrigerate the product in the foil pouch, continuing to protect it from light: i.e., "allows use of product through its labeled expiry." It would be greatly appreciated if some additional information could be provided regarding the above situation. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?

SUBJECT: Ankle Injury MESSAGE: I got hurt in my left leg ankle almost 5 months ago. I went to doctor, got x-ray, where no damage was found. He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this. Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.
