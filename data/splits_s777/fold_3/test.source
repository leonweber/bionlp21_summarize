SUBJECT: how to breathe MESSAGE: Dear Sirs,  This may seem like a stupid question but here goes anyway.  I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]

I am only doing this because I am trying to find an answer to a baffling situation I am experiencing. I started taking Phentermine about 3 years ago for weight loss. I lost weight successfully, but also found that the Phentermine substantially relieved my arthritis pain. Now my doctor has taken me off of the Phentermine. He will not prescribe it for pain relief as he does not believe there is any correlation between the Phentermine and relief of my arthritis pain. I have taken many pain relief medications over the years as my arthritis is acute. The Phentermine works the best. Is there any correlation between Phentermine and pain relief?  Sincerely, [NAME]
