SUBJECT: Decreasing Wellbutrin HCL XL MESSAGE: Hello, I'm not sure if this is something you can help me with, but I thought that I would ask, as your organization is affiliated with trusted mental health and general health organizations.  I was recently taken off of Wellbutrin HCL XL completely without any tapering. I'm having a difficult time finding out online if this is safe (to "go cold turkey") or if I should have been given the medication in slowly-decreasing doses. Can you please offer some guidance?  Thank you. [NAME]
