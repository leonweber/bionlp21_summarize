I'm 53 years old. I have got  meniscus tear after a twist. My MRI reports  that I  have got: 1. Bucket handle tear involving entire length of lateral meniscus which otherwise appears to have discoid configuration. 2. complex tear involving posterior horn and posterior root of medial meniscus,  along with formation of few small parameniscal cysts. I am doing all activities without any problem. I have no swelling . I get pain at times for 2 or 3 min.  Sometimes even after 4 or 5 days or after a week. sometimes 2 or 3 days consecutively.  In June, I twisted my right knee.  During this period I was even without pain for 10 days or 2 weeks. Kindly advise me .
I am experiencing a tapeworm infection that I think has gone beyond my intestines and is in my muscle now. After taking a dose of the worm medicine (Praziquantel), I believe I’m an still infected. My body is now fighting skin ulcerations I believe to be from the parasite in my muscle. I’ve been trying to address that as I don’t think the Rx I took was enough to rid me of the infection. My doctor is at a loss for knowing how to treat me and the referrals I’ve received and numerous calls I’ve made are always dead ends here in the Houston Tx area. Can you please help me? I would like some information as to how to best be completely rid of this parasite infection. I will greatly appreciate your assistance and or a solid referral to someone who is treating patients for parasites. I have good pics and hopefully someone can identify the exact tapeworm I’m infected with and explain protocols for ridding them from all parts of my body.
It is unfortunate to say that my father was affected by AML M1 and  we got  to know a month ago and his age is 52. Initially he  had a blast cells percentage of 76% and later after the first cycle blast cells dropped down to 4%. After two weeks of rest, he had undergone first consolidation out of three with High intensity Ara-C and today he was discharged after one week of treatment. My father's doctor said that there will be two more cycles with a gap of 28 days in between. As chemotherapy has side effects I would like to go for ayurvedic treatment as well in order to support my father's condition. I'm unable to understand whether to take further step and go for ayurveda as I'm not aware of any proved cases. Please suggest me whether to go for ayurveda and are there any such cases recorded to keep  the disease in complete remission.

Good morning.  I have a question for a urologist or a surgeon.  This may be out there but I am not one to go with the flow.  Now I do not have prostate cancer but I like being ready for anything.  I will be having a blood test next week and then I will be seeing my doctor.  My PSA was up from the last few.  2015 - 0.4   2016 - 0.7 and 2017 - 2.2.  Now here is my question.   If I get prostate cancer and lets say that the tumor is in the right lobe can I just have the right lobe removed.  Nothing else.  Maybe the lymph node on that side but I do not want anything else removed  I do not want the bladder neck touch or the seminal vesicles or the other side of the prostate.  I know you must think this is crazy but I feel my sex life and my ejaculation is just as important to save as getting rid of the cancer.  I have been reading to many articles that say they take every because you may get cancer there.  So you are going to take out good tissue just because you may get it again.  I don't believe in that.  My urologist call me his challenge.  I do not give up total control.  Thank you for your time.  I hope you have a great day.

Hello, I have been dealing with trimethylaminuria since I was a child. I have done some of my own research and it looks like not much can be done for this condition. I do not have it all over my body it’s only in my armpits. In the past I’ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. I don’t know maybe I’m wrong. But this disease isn’t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. I’m sure they’re thousands of women with it... Can I be tested for it and help in some kind of way to finding a cure or something?  What testing is done for this?  And where? Thank you

I had the bladder sling surgery and the incontinence was cured for 1 week and then the leaking began again.  The Dr wanted to prescribe a pill to stop the leaking but I waited until I went back  for my one month check up, all the while leaking just as bad as I did before the surgery.  When she examined me she said the bladder had slipped out of the sling and we would have to do the surgery again this time she would suture it to the ligament behind the pelvic bone.   My question is this:  #1. why would it slip?  was she supposed to suture it before to prevent the slipping? what guarantees that it won't slip again?  I am very concerned about having to go under anesthesia again and certainly do not want to risk having to go yet a 3rd time to solve my stress incontinence issues. Thank you for ever help you can give with these answers.

Hi, Please can you help - I am writing from South Africa. My daughter suffers with acute folliculitus, and has been since the age of 13. She is now 20 and is in so much distress as nothing seems to alleviate the itching and soreness. She is desperate for some relief and we have tried absolutely everything - creams, shampoos, antibiotics, biopsies, blood tests, allergy tests, light therapy, diet etc. We have consulted Professors of Dermatology but they do not know how to treat it. She is now getting suicidal thoughts as it is extremely debilitating and cries a lot. They have tested for both fungal and bacterial and have grown cultures to see what attacks it - nothing does. I am writing to you for any help you could give me to try and assist her. Could you recommend a specialist and someone who could help us with research? Please could you point us in the right direction? I am happy to send through her lab tests - please let me know. Thanks

I am trying to get some information.  I had eye surgery.  My surgical tech was clearly sick.  My hubby and i overheard her say she could not go home because they had no one to cover her.  When I was in the room alone with her and she was preparing for my surgery I clearly saw her clearing her throat coughing and touching her face covering her cough with the back of her hand.. I questioned her about the safety of her being there with a cold.. said dont worry thats why I have the mask on.. I put my trust in her went along with it.. 2 days later my nose was running profusely.. I called doctors office and they said dont worry its happens..that was a friday.. On monday I called the office and asked to be seen because my eye had started to swell..  it turns out i had developed an abscess  (endophtlamitis) now i am blind..  My understanding from reading your website the room was not sterile (air circulation) and the masks are not 100 percent germ proof..she was standing close to me handing the doctor tools i feel i was not safe with her coughing and touching them...I am looking for answers...thanks for all your help

My father had hip surgery. About one month he was detected an infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. They started to give him intravenous ertanpenem. After almost a month, he is having episodes of seizures. He never had before. The doctors say that ertanpenem has nothing to do with it and they continue to provide it and at the same time they are giving him anti-seizure medication. I would like to know if it is correct or is at risk for his life. Thank you very much
